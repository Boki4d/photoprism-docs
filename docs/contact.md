## PhotoPrism® Trademark ##

Please always use our [official logo](https://dl.photoprism.org/img/logo/logo.svg), do not alter it in any way,
and avoid overlapping with other logos or images.

When referring to PhotoPrism, make sure that it is spelled correctly:

* the name has two capital letters, so Photoprism is not a correct spelling
* PhotoPrism is one word and must not be separated into two words

Our [trademark and brand guidelines](https://photoprism.app/trademark), which may be updated from time to time,
describe how our Brand Assets may be used. It is important to us that any permitted use of our Brand Assets is

## Sustainability and Environmental Protection ##
<img src="https://dl.photoprism.app/img/badges/green-power.svg" width="130" style="padding: 0 0 30px 30px; float: right;">
Sustainability has been a core value for us from the beginning. That's why we ensure our office and hosting infrastructure is powered by 100% climate-neutral, renewable energy.

More information can be found on the website of [Polarstern Energie](https://link.photoprism.app/polarstern "100% certified renewable energy"), the electricity provider for our Berlin office, as well as in the statements of our infrastructure partners [Hetzner Online](https://link.photoprism.app/sustainability-hetzner "Backend Services") and [DigitalOcean](https://link.photoprism.app/sustainability-digitalocean "DNS and Cloud Hosting").

We do not engage in crypto mining at this time and will fully assess the environmental impact before permanently adopting any distributed ledger technologies.
