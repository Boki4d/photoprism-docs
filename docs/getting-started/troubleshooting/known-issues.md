# Known Bugs and Issues

This overview documents issues of general concern until they can be addressed. PhotoPrism has a zero-bug policy, which means we work to resolve all problems we learn about.

In order to improve readability and reduce maintenance, minor issues and those we plan to fix in the short term are not listed here. You can browse all reported bugs, ideas, and planned improvements on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues).
