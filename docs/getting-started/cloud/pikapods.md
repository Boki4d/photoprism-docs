## First Steps

1. Choose whether you want to [index your files](../../user-guide/library/index.md) so that the original file and folder names are preserved, or import them so that they are automatically sorted by year and month.
2. To add files, you can either copy them to your *Import* or *Originals* folder via [WebDAV](../../user-guide/sync/webdav.md), or [upload them using the Web UI](../../user-guide/library/upload.md) which will import them automatically after the upload is complete.
3. Finally, set up [automatic syncing](../../user-guide/sync/mobile-devices.md) from your phone and install the [Progressive Web App (PWA)](../../user-guide/pwa.md) on your desktop, tablet, and phone home screens as needed.
