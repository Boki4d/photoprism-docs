## Setting Up Your Devices

1. [Choose](../../user-guide/library/index.md) whether you want to [index your originals](../../user-guide/library/originals.md) so that the existing file and folder names are preserved, or [import them](../../user-guide/library/import.md) so that they are automatically organized by year and month.
2. To add pictures, you can either copy them to the *import* or *originals* folder using [WebDAV](../../user-guide/sync/webdav.md), or [upload them](../../user-guide/library/upload.md) with the web user interface, which will import them automatically after upload.
3. Finally, set up [automatic syncing](../../user-guide/sync/mobile-devices.md) from your mobile phone and install the [Progressive Web App (PWA)](../../user-guide/pwa.md) on your desktop, tablet, and phone home screens as needed.
