# Duplicates #

## Exact duplicates ##
PhotoPrism automatically detects exact duplicates for you. 

When you use [import](./import.md), duplicates are skipped, so you don't have duplicate files in your library.

If you use [index](./originals.md), duplicates are also detected; they appear only once in PhotoPrism's views. 
Viewing and deleting duplicate files via the Web UI is [planned](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1308).

## Related files ##
Besides exact duplicates, there may be related files in your library, e.g

- raw + jpg + xmp
- jpg  + json
- original + edited version
- original + compressed version
- timelapse photos

Related files can be [stacked](../organize/stacks.md) automatically.
