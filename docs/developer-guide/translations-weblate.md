    3. Repeat until all strings are translated
    
      Your translations will be reviewed and included in one of the next releases.

=== "Review translations"
    
    If translations are missing, we pre-translate messages using services such as DeepL and Google Translate. 
    This can lead to grammatical errors and misunderstandings. 
    Native speakers should check existing translations and improve them if necessary.

    If you are a native speaker and would like to support us by reviewing existing translations, please write to us at hello@photoprism.app so that we can grant you the rights to review.
    
    1. From your *Dashboard* open one of the components by clicking on the language

    3. Review the translation - edit the string if needed. Then select *Approved* and click *Save and continue*

=== "Add new language"
