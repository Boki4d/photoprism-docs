# Code Quality

**The quality of code has a practical impact on both your agility and the cost of development:**[^1]

- you can't change buggy and/or bloated code fast enough to be truly agile
- existing bugs can easily increase development costs (and time) by 10x
- the mess eventually becomes so big and so deep that you cannot clean it up anymore[^2]

## Keep It Simple ##

!!! example ""
    Simple, elegant solutions are [more effective](issues.md#effectiveness-efficiency), but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more
    time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable. ‚Äî <cite>Niklaus Wirth, Feb 1985</cite>

## Caching Is Hard ##

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: [cache invalidation](https://msol.io/blog/tech/youre-probably-wrong-about-caching/) and naming things.

!!! example ""
    A cache is just a memory leak you haven't met yet. ‚Äî <cite>Dave Cheney</cite>

## Bottom-Up Development ##

Breaking a problem down into small, coherent fragments lends itself to organization. Start with the basic low-level
components and then proceed to higher-level abstractions.

Bottom-up development emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin before having a detailed understanding 
of the final system. In practice, that may never really exist as requirements are constantly evolving.

Advantages of the bottom-up approach are component reusability, agility, and testability.

!!! example ""
    I compared Mel's hand-optimized programs with the same code massaged by the optimizing assembler program, and Mel's always ran faster.
    That was because the ‚Äútop-down‚Äù method of program design hadn't been invented yet, and Mel wouldn't have used it anyway. 
    He wrote the innermost parts of his program loops first. ‚Äî <cite>[The Story of Mel](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html)</cite>

## Avoid Unnecessary Abstractions and Optimizations ##

Don't abstract if you don't have to. Premature optimization causes unnecessary pain and leads to bloated code that fewer developers understand.

Instead, perform test-driven [bottom-up development](#bottom-up-development), so you can [safely refactor](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DefinitionOfRefactoring.html)
if and when it makes sense. Maintaining small amounts of duplicate code is much easier and less burdensome than choosing the wrong abstraction.

!!! example ""
    Premature optimization is the root of all evil. ‚Äî <cite>Donald Knuth</cite>

## Opportunistic Refactoring ##

While we know this is difficult when working with a distributed team, branches, and pull requests, we encourage all
contributors to refactor when they see a specific problem.

Ideally when you are working on the same code anyway to implement a feature or improvement. This helps to verify
that the changes are helpful in practice.

Imperfection is not a big problem as long as your code is testable and tests exist so that formatting and
implementation details can be easily improved at a later time and/or by another developer.

No one needs nice-looking code that doesn't work. Be pragmatic. Done is better than perfect.
Pretty much all software projects start this way.

However, if you know about (potential) security issues, please [report them to us](https://photoprism.app/security-policy) immediately and, if possible, offer a solution.

!!! example ""
    Feel free to think ahead, just don't code ahead. But also, don't feel the need to decide so many
    details ahead. Learn enough to get started and build only what you need.
    ‚Äî <cite>[J. B. Rainsberger](https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/1064212803542818816)</cite>

## Go Slow Before You Go Fast üê∞ ##

You have to go slow before you can go fast. Understand the big picture and gather missing information before
starting to code. Read the documentation. Write tests. Take your time. Stay focused.

!!! example ""
    All developers with more than a few years experience know that previous messes slow them down. And yet all
    developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines. In short, they don‚Äôt take the time
    to go fast! You will not make the deadline by making a mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and
    will force you to miss the deadline. ‚Äî <cite>Robert C. Martin[^2]</cite>

## Code That Cannot Be Tested Is Flawed ##

We strive for [complete test coverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html) as it is a useful tool for finding 
untested parts of our code base. Test coverage is of limited use as a numerical statement of how good our tests are.

The *F.I.R.S.T.* principle includes five rules that good tests should follow:[^2]

**Fast:** If tests are slow, you won't run them frequently, which makes them much less useful and increases the cost of development.<br>
**Independent:** You should be able to run each test independently and run the tests in any order you like. When tests depend on each other, then the first one to fail causes a cascade of downstream failures, making diagnosis difficult and hiding downstream defects.<br>
**Repeatable:** If your tests aren‚Äôt repeatable in any environment, then you‚Äôll always have an excuse for why they fail. You‚Äôll also find yourself unable to run the tests when the environment isn‚Äôt available.<br>
**Self-Validating:** You should not have to read through a log file to tell whether the tests pass. If the tests aren‚Äôt
self-validating, then failure can become subjective and running the tests can require a long manual evaluation.<br>
**Timely:** If you write tests after the production code, then you may find the production code to be hard to test. You may decide that some production code is too hard to test. You may not design the production code to be testable.

### Codecov [![Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/photoprism/photoprism/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)][codecov] ###

A coverage log file created by the Go test runner is automatically sent to [Codecov][codecov] every time our `develop` branch was successfully built and tested on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/photoprism/photoprism). Codecov provides a beautiful UI for displaying coverage reports and renders a badge showing the current test coverage. Custom settings for our report are located in [codecov.yml](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/codecov.yml). For example, `range: 50..90` means the badge will be green if coverage is >= 90% and red if it is <= 50%.

## Use Quality Reports as Inspiration ##

[goreportcard.com][goreport] generates reports on the quality of Open Source Go projects. It uses several measures,
including `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go lint` and `gocyclo`:

    Not every problem reported by tools is really important and needs to be fixed immediately. Use the reports as
    inspiration when you need some.
