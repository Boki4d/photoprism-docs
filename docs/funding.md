# Help Us Make a Difference

**We value freedom and privacy.** Serving free beer[^1] doesn't bring us closer to our vision 
and doesn't get you better software.

Please back us on [Patreon](https://link.photoprism.app/patreon) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsor) if you enjoy PhotoPrism.
Your continued support helps us provide regular updates[^2] and services like [world maps](https://try.photoprism.app/places).

We currently have the following sponsorship options:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsor) is priced in USD and also offers [one-time donations](https://link.photoprism.app/donate)
- [Patreon](https://link.photoprism.app/patreon) is priced in Euro and also offers yearly payments
- Stripe will be available in early 2022, so you can sign up directly in the app without having a Patreon or GitHub account
- You are welcome to [contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) for [crypto donations](https://photoprism.app/crypto-donations), bank account details, and business partnerships

Sponsors get access to [additional features](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=label%3Asponsor-feature), receive direct [technical support](https://photoprism.app/contact) via email, and can join our private chat room on [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/).
In addition, ideas endorsed by [silver, gold, and platinum sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsors) 
receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and
will be prioritized on the [roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap).

We encourage everyone who can afford it to become a sponsor as this is ultimately best for the product
and the community.

[^1]: Think of “free software” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

[^2]: Unlike traditional offline apps such as Microsoft Office or single-player games, software exposed to the Internet must be [updated regularly](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) to stay secure and compatible with the latest standards.
